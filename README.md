## Introduction

In this project I created an interactive sketching platform called Etch-a-Sketch using various javascript tools and concepts which I learned throughout my learning journey. This platform lets the user to draw and illustrate pictures or paintings in a grid format as this uses a grid like pattern to assist users in creating stunning and exquisite visual artwork. So immerse yourself in creating stunning art by leveraging various features which my platform provides such as various color modes such as rainbow, various color options to choose from and giving stunning visuals and effects. Also look for the demo pics at the end to get a grasp of my platform and further necessary details are provided below.

## Features

- Draw simple and stunning artworks
- Use various color modes
- Toggle border for a grater visibility
- Grids for assistance
- Custom grid size available for your needs
- Hover modes for smooth and precise drawing
- Countless colors to choose from
- range grid creations for smaller grid creation

## Technologies and Tools

# Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# Tools

- Conditionals
- Functions
- Variables
- Loops
- Event Listeners
- DOM Manipulation

## Usage

With its simple and intuitive design it is very simple to use with but there are some certain things to keep in mind before using it because some buttons may seem to overly complicate the functioning of other buttons. But first lets get a step by step overview of its usage -:

- First toggle the pen button to start it.
- Then choose the color you want(default is black)
- Toggle the borders
- Erase if you need to make correction

# Things to remember

Keep these things in mind before using this site to avoid some complications

- Eraser mode automatically turns off other buttons like that of pen rainbow and darken and to turn these on you have to turn the eraser mode off first.
- Turning other buttons automatically turns of its predecessors such as turning pen mode on automatically turns off rainbow and vice versa
- Darken mode can only be turned on if eraser, pen and rainbow buttons are off
- Hover can be turned on irrespectively of other buttons and even eraser.

These complications are provided to stimulate a smooth user experience but if they seem too much feel free to drop a text :)

## Key Concepts

- Conditionals: These are used extensively and frequently in my code as was necessary in my code and logic here. They are mainly used in giving color logic to the createGrid functions as well as ternary operator is used for button styling as well.

- Loops: Loops here are used for grid creation i.e. for the creation of their rows as well as columns and for that rainbow button i.e random color function as well.

- Functions: The backbone of any programming language is heavily used here as well as it makes things easier to structure the code as well. Both function declarations as well as function expressions are used extensively.

- DOM Manipulation: These, along with Event Listeners, are used heavily in this code for javascript as manipulating DOM nodes was a necessary part of the project here.

- Event Listeners: These are used heavily in my code to provide various features to this drawing platforms such as pen option and that rainbow one and many more as well.

## Learnings

To be honest, it was a tiring project but it made sure to teach me a lot of things and I genuinely learned a lot of things and significantly broadened my horizons of knowledge in this field and I learned a lot and lot of things and I mean it. Some of the few things I learned which I would like to share to anyone reading this so be it my future self or anyone other -:

- I learned a lot about event listeners and came to understand how they are an integral part of the javascript and how they make javascript a dynamic language. I learned about callback functions in them and how they are the backbone of interactivity for html elements, especially, the button element as well as the input too. Not only that I also learned about various types of event listeners as well and their various methods or objects(I've not learned about them yet but soon will) such as a problem I faced which was so much simple yet integral for me which was solved through by including preventdefault() in that mousedown event listener and various other events as well.

- The other thing I learned was about DOM Manipulation and how to store them using variables mainly constant ones and how querySelector is best of them all and also the one thing I learned was about querySelectorAll which creates a node list not an array(there's a difference) and how we should convert it to an array before using them or just use forEach() as well. And they are part of event listeners as well so when we are studying DOM manipulation study these events as well. I also learned about various DOM methods as well such as creating nodes, appending them, changing their text content etc.

- I also learned about nested loops, I had learned them before but never used them in this way I used here to create rows and columns i.e that grid pattern and then later appended them.

- But the most important of the learnings, I learned through here is that sometimes the solution of the problem is just before your eyes so don't look far away for the solutions look near you the solution is just beside you, and understanding the problem also helps. So my future self if you ever read this, remember this learning it might help in not just solving programming problems but personal ones too.
